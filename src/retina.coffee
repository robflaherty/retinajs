# We don't wrap this up into any kind of namespace 
# because we want it to be self-executing on page load
# The CoffeeScript compiler automatically wraps it in
# closure for safety, passing the window object.

# To keep things minimal, we intentionally don't get fancy here 
# by using classes or functions. The Closure Compiler optimizes
# everything quite a bit, but the trick here is keeping everything fast.


# First check that we're on a retina device.
# We don't even want this guy executing if we're not.
# Bind everything to the window object's onload.
# This helps wait for the images to get loaded into the DOM.
